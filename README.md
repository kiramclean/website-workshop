# Website Workshop

This is the source for a tutorial on how to build a simple website. I originally gave it as a workshop live at a [learnathon](https://www.kurius.ca/learnathon) for high school students, but tried on purpose to write it in a way that would be useful for people who can't follow along with me in real time.

That link explains in human terms what that means, but in short it means please do share this freely and widely, but you cannot use it for commercial purposes and if you remix, transform, or build upon the material you must distribute your new content under the same terms.

I chose this license because I put a lot effort into making this tutorial for a free workshop for people brand new to programming, who are typically young and don't have their own resources to spend on programming courses. I want to make sure everyone has access to the same (or changed, better, improved) material under the same terms.
